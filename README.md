# BSPEC
BSPEC: A Plugin, Entity Component System (ECS) architecture designed with Business Specifications in mind 

# Status of the project
> Current version: `0.0.1`

The BSPEC is still under initial development and is being tested with the Python 3.9.6 version.

The BSPEC will follow semantic versioning for its releases, with a `{MAJOR}.{MINOR}.{PATCH}` scheme for versions numbers, where:

* `MAJOR` versions might introduce breaking changes
* `MINOR` versions usually introduce new features and might introduce deprecations
* `PATCH` versions only introduce bug fixes
